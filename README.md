It's simple chat app, similar to twitch, discord, slack etc. using vanillaJS + Node.js (Express) + ofc websockets (Socket.io). 
So far i've built it for local try,  trying to push it to heroku, but go some small issues, 
once i'll fix it, i'm gonna drop a ling to check live and global version of it ;)
